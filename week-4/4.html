                <h2>JavaScript as an Interpreted Language</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is known as an interpreted language because it is executed line by line by the JavaScript engine in the web browser or Node.js environment. This means that the code is parsed and executed directly without requiring a separate compilation step into machine code.</p>
                <p>Here's how it works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Parsing:</strong> The JavaScript engine reads the code and converts it into an intermediate representation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Execution:</strong> The code is executed directly by the JavaScript engine in real-time. This allows for dynamic execution and rapid development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactivity:</strong> As an interpreted language, JavaScript allows for immediate feedback and interaction, which is ideal for web development where changes can be tested on the fly.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This interpretative approach contrasts with compiled languages like C or Java, which require a compilation step to convert the source code into executable machine code before running.</p>
